/*
**	This module contains the pixel-pushing blitter objects. These objects only
**	serve one purpose. That is, to move pixels from one location to another. These
**	are prime candidates for optimization since they are called frequently and
**	loop greatly.
**
**	The large variety of blitter objects is necessary because there is a rich
**	set of pixel operations required by the game engine. Complicating this is that
**	the game engine must support both 16 bit and 8 bit pixel formats. Some of these
**	blitter objects are templates (this reduces the need for both 8 and 16 bit
**	counterparts if the algorithm is constant between pixel formats). Also note
**	that there are some assembly implementations where it seems appropriate.
**
**	If the blitter object has "Xlat" in the name, then this means that the source
**	pixel is 8 bit and the destination pixel is 16 bit (probably). This hybrid system
**	allows the game artwork to be shared between the two pixel format displays. To
**	accomplish this, a translation table is supplied to the blit operation so that
**	the 8 bit pixel can be converted into the appropriate 16 bit destination pixel.
**	If the destination surface is also 8 bit, then the translation table converts
**	the pixel to the logical palette color index appropriate for the display.
